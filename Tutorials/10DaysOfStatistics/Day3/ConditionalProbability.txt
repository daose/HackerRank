 * Answer could be either (1/2) or (1/3) depending on how the question is interpreted
 * WIKIPEDIA: "From all families with two children, at least one of whom is a boy, a family is chosen at random. This would yield the answer of 1/3.
 * From all families with two children, one child is selected at random, and the sex of that child is specified to be a boy. This would yield an answer of 1/2."

Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?
------------
P(A|B) = P(A AND B)/P(B)
P(boy|boy) = P(boy AND boy)/P(boy) = (1/4)/(3/4) = (1/4)*(4/3) = 4/12 = 1/3
